# Linear Sorting (definitely not an obfuscated Rick Roll)
This is definitely not a heavily obfuscated script that sets the user's volume to the max (using AppleScript so macOS only) and opens a browser to play Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". I definitely didn't spend 4 hours at college working on this so I could mess with my friends while they were in the study room. No way :)
